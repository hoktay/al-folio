  title={Demographic Breakdown of Twitter Users: An analysis based on names},
  abstract={We propose an approach for age estimation using
solely people’s first names by extending an already
existing method proposed by Chang et al. for ethnicity
estimation. We demonstrate that proposed
method is able to predict age of a person as well
as the age breakdown of an entire population better
than the natural alternatives. We then apply
both the age and the ethnicity method to Twitter
US users and perform the largest demographic analysis
of the platform to the best of our knowledge.
First, we closely replicate the findings about Twitter
demographics in the most recent Pew Research report
suggesting that name might be a useful indicator
especially for aggregate analysis. Second, we demonstrate
that our approach can overcome a methodological
limitation in Pew Research study by estimating
breakdown for all age groups including less than 18
years old age group. Third, we discover that Twitter
US users has always been diverse, though some demographic
groups are over-represented and some are
under-represented with respect to the general internet
users. We also find strong evidence that different
demographic groups both in terms of age and ethnicity
have different usage patterns on the platform in
terms of their following relationships, topical conversations,
and the time in the day to use the platform.},

    abstract = {In the United States, seasonal influenza causes thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations. The annual timing and burden of the flu season vary considerably with the severity of the circulating viruses. Epidemic forecasting can inform early and effective countermeasures to limit the human toll of severe seasonal and pandemic influenza. With a growing toolkit of sophisticated statistical methods and the recent explosion of influenza-related data, we can now systematically match models to data to achieve timely and accurate warning as flu epidemics emerge, peak and subside. Here, we introduce a framework for identifying optimal combinations of data sources, and show that public health surveillance data and electronic health records collectively forecast seasonal influenza better than any single data source alone and better than influenza-related search engine and social media data.},

title = {The maximum independent union of cliques problem: complexity and exact approaches},
journal = {Journal of Global Optimization},
abstract = {Given a simple graph, the maximum independent union of cliques problem is to find a maximum-cardinality subset of vertices such that each connected component of the corresponding induced subgraph is a complete graph. This recently introduced problem allows both cliques and independent sets as feasible solutions and is of significant theoretical and applied interest. This paper establishes the complexity of the problem on several classes of graphs (planar, claw-free, and bipartite graphs), and develops an integer programming formulation and an exact combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm for solving it. Results of numerical experiments with numerous benchmark instances are also reported.},

ABSTRACT = {Given a simple, undirected graph G, a biclique is a subset of vertices inducing a complete bipartite subgraph in G. In this paper, we consider two associated optimization problems, the maximum biclique problem, which asks for a biclique of the maximum cardinality in the graph, and the maximum edge biclique problem, aiming to find a biclique with the maximum number of edges in the graph. These NP-hard problems find applications in biclustering-type tasks arising in complex network analysis. Real-life instances of these problems often involve massive, but sparse networks. We develop exact approaches for detecting optimal bicliques in large-scale graphs that combine effective scale reduction techniques with integer programming methodology. Results of computational experiments with numerous real-life network instances demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Many complex systems involve entities that interact with each other through various relationships (e.g., people in social systems, neurons in the brain). These entities and interactions are commonly represented using graphs due to several advantages. This dissertation focuses on developing theory and algorithms for novel methods in graph theory and optimization, and their applications to social and brain networks. Specifically, the major contributions of this dissertation are three fold. First, this dissertation aims not only to develop a new clique relaxation model based on a structural metric, clustering coefficient, but also to introduce a novel graph clustering algorithm using this model. Clique relaxations are used in classical models of cohesive subgroups in social network analysis. Clustering coefficient was introduced more recently as a structural feature characterizing small-world networks. Leveraging the similarities between the concepts of cohesive subgroups and small-world networks (i.e., graphs that are highly clustered with small path lengths). The first part of this dissertation introduces a new clique relaxation, α-cluster, defined by enforcing a lower bound α on the clustering coefficient in the corresponding induced subgraph. Two different definitions of the clustering coefficient are considered, namely, the local and global clustering coefficient. Certain structural properties of α-clusters are analyzed, and mathematical optimization models for determining the largest size α-clusters in a network are developed and applied to several real-life social network instances. In addition, a network clustering algorithm based on local α-cluster is introduced and successfully evaluated. Second, this dissertation explores a novel mathematical model called the maximum independent union of cliques problem (max IUC problem), which arises as a special case of α-clusters. It is an interesting problem for which both the maximum clique and maximum independent sets are feasible solutions and individually their corresponding sizes are lower bounds for the size of the IUC solution. After presenting the structural properties as well as the complexity results of different graph types (planar, unit disk graphs and claw-free graphs), an integer programming formulation is developed, followed by a branch-and-bound algorithm and several heuristic methods to approximate the maximum independent union of cliques problem. The developed methods have been empirically evaluated on many benchmark instances. Finally, this dissertation, in collaboration with Texas Institute of Preclinical Studies (TIPS), applies clique relaxation models to explore a new experimental data to understand the effect of concussion on animal brains. Our research involves cohesive and robust clustering analysis of animal brain networks utilizing a unique and novel experimental data. In collaboration with TIPS, we have analyzed multiple pairs of fMRI data about animal brains that are measured before and after a concussion. We utilize network analysis to first identify the similar regions in animal brains, and then compare how these regions as well as graph structural properties change before and after a concussion. To the best of our knowledge, this study is unique in the literature in that it not only explicitly examines the relation between concussion level and the functional unit interaction but also uses very detailed and fine-grained fMRI measurements of brain data.}
