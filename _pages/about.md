I am intrigued by building mathematical models and optimization solutions to **high-impact real-world problems in healthcare systems** by leveraging large-scale mixed integer programming, graph theory, and stochastic simulation methods. My recent research is focused on the optimization of **infectious disease surveillance systems** and control policies, and the development of decision-support software for pandemic preparedness and response.
